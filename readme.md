## Pull Requests
The main point about this repository is to provide the sourcecode of the current release version of Stadia Enhanced.
Pull requests for new feature implementations will be manually merged into the (non-public) dev version and tested for errors, before being released with the next public version of the extension. Please post updates to translations in their respective discussions. No content will be pulled directly into the current release version.
