## Discord Presence

### Installation
If you want to showcase your currently played game via Discord, Stadia Enhanced supports [DiscordRPC](https://github.com/lolamtisch/Discord-RPC-Extension).

Simply follow these two steps:
1. Install the [DiscordRPC extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/discord-rich-presence/agnaejlkbiiggajjmnpmeheigkflbnoo)
2. Get the [DiscordRPC desktop app](https://github.com/lolamtisch/Discord-RPC-Extension/releases/)

<details>
  <summary>Why DiscordRPC? - Full Details</summary>
  
  ### Why DiscordRPC?

  Using Discord via your browser directly isn't possible due to multiple limitations, it will require a dedicated desktop app that acts as the middleman for Discord and your browser - the team behind DiscordRPC is providing exactly that, while also allowing you to use the same extension/app combination to display other presences (i.e. for your music), including the management of active (games) vs. passive (music) presences and other things.

  **"But, why don't you just develop your own app to do this, or "copy" their work?"**

  The reason i'm not developing my own solution for this feature is rather simple; time. Increasing the time i have to spend on the project by adding more and more onto it, would decrease the time available to actually make sure that things are working correctly in the first place. Discord RPC offers a easy to implement solution (that is entirely optional for the user) while taking care of the maintenance at the same time.

  I *could* simply copy their work (as in; fork their project and effectively copy the functionality of their extension into mine, while using their desktop app) but that would result in two issues:

  1. This is a project for the community and i want to respect the work spend on everything included in it. While it would *legally* be perfectly fine to just implement their work, effectively claiming that i "came up" with this as a solution, for me *personally*, is not.
  2. Simply copying their work, would also make it basically impossible for the user to also use DiscordRPC, due to compatibility issues, like the priority management. Using Discords presence system via the browser is only covered by not even a handful of well working projects and i want to avoid cutting that down further - especially if the cost is simply having to run a second, unnoticeable (performance-whise) extension that works as install-and-forget.

## Pull Requests
The main point about this repository is to provide the sourcecode of the current release version of Stadia Enhanced.

Pull requests for new feature implementations will be manually merged into the (non-public) dev version and tested for errors, before being released with the next public version of the extension.

Please post updates to translations in their respective discussions. No content will be pulled directly into the current release version.
