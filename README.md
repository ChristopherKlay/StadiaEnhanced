## Features

* Set VP9 as the preferred codec.
* Enable 4K (requires GPU with support for VP9 decoding).
* Stream Monitor (Displays frame/package loss among other things), via the group menu.
* Changeable library size on the home screen, toggle between 2 up to 6 items per row.
* Settings for codec, resolution and library size are saved between sessions.

## Known Issues

* The injection needed for the monitor blocks the user from joining voice chats. This issues sadly also exists in Stadia+ and the base script of the monitor. Currently working on a solution.

## Installation
* Install a userscript manager for chrome like [Violentmonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag) | [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo).
* Click the extension at the top right of your browser to open it's menu.
* Select "+" or "Create new script" depending on the extension you use.
* Copy and paste the content of [the script](https://github.com/ChristopherKlay/StadiaEnhanced/blob/master/main.js) into the new window and save it.
