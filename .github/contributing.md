# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

While the source code of this project is openly available and support (not just in terms of development, but feedback, translations and other sources) is always welcome, there's guidelines (structure, stability, but also legal restrictions in terms of usage with the Google Stadia service and more) the project aims to maintain. Any changes (outside of translations) to this project will be tested (by the maintainer of this project) in a (non-public) developer version of the extension first, before being pushed to the project page and Chrome Store, as a new release build.

## Translation Files

Updates that consist of changes to translation files will be pulled into the current version whenever possible, if no conflicts with the translation topic for the given language exist.

The project page however features [discussions](https://github.com/ChristopherKlay/StadiaEnhanced/discussions/categories/translations) for translations, that should be used primarily. This is mainly done to avoid issues, but also helps keeping the entire community involved in the process of translating the extension - instead of effectively providing a "This should just be X" option that ignores said discussions and possible feedback, if a topic for the given language already exists.
