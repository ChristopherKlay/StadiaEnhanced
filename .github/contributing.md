# Contributing

This repository is solely meant to allow users of the project to easily access the current source code of the project, push updates to translations and more.

Pull requests for smaller fixes/changes are fine, but (see explanation below) development/management of the extension including the dev build, is limited to the author of this project.

    <summary>Detailed Explanation</summary>
    The community has always been a vital part of the development of this project, especially feature requests, bug reports and translations.
    
    I however decided to limit development of the actual extension (as in; features, code structure, ..) to myself in the future, mostly for personal reasons.
    I personally feel like i can push out new features faster and work on the extension more often, when i work on it alone, without the need to keep other changes in the back of my head, especially when juggling with multiple projects in the future and/or in moments where my time available to spend on these projects is limited and i have to either test/integrate/manage other changes, or work on my own updates.
    
    Outside of the actual development, everything (including the mentioned feature requests, translations and more) everything else will stay the same.

## Translation Files

Updates that consist of changes to translation files will be pulled into the current version whenever possible, if no conflicts with the translation topic for the given language exist.

The project page however features [discussions](https://github.com/ChristopherKlay/StadiaEnhanced/discussions/categories/translations) for translations, that should be used primarily. This is mainly done to avoid issues, but also helps keeping the entire community involved in the process of translating the extension - instead of effectively providing a "This should just be X" option that ignores said discussions and possible feedback, if a topic for the given language already exists.
