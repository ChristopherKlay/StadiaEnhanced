## Your language is currently not supported?
If your language is not currently supported and no translation is available under [issues](https://github.com/ChristopherKlay/StadiaEnhanced/labels/translation), you can help translate the extension by doing the following:

1. While visiting the [Stadia](https://stadia.com/) homepage, open your console (Ctrl+Shift+I).
2. If you have Stadia Enhanced installed, you will see log entries, beginning with an entry for your username, ID and language code.
3. Submit a copy of the current template below with the values on the right side translated together with your language code via a [issues entry](https://github.com/ChristopherKlay/StadiaEnhanced/issues), so we do not get duplicates and/or more refined translations due to access of multiple people.

Due to following Stadias language settings, languages like "en_GB"/"en_US" will default to "en".
