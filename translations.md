# Translations

# Important Note
Version `1.8.0` revamped a big part of the menu and thus the needed translation lines changed heavily. As always english and german are supported by default, but i've disabled other languages (they will for now default to english) until the translations are available - they will be patched in whenever available.

## Available languages
Stadia Enhanced is currently available in the following languages:

## Your language is currently not supported?
If your language is not currently supported and no translation is available under [translations](https://github.com/ChristopherKlay/StadiaEnhanced/discussions?discussions_q=category%3ATranslations), you can help translate the extension by doing the following:

1. While visiting the [Stadia](https://stadia.com/) homepage, open your console (Ctrl+Shift+I).
2. If you have Stadia Enhanced installed, you will see log entries, beginning with an entry for your username, ID and language code.
3. Submit a copy of the current template below with the values on the right side translated together with your language code via a [new entry](https://github.com/ChristopherKlay/StadiaEnhanced/discussions?discussions_q=category%3ATranslations), so we do not get duplicates and/or more refined translations due to access of multiple people.

Due to following Stadias language settings, languages like "en_GB"/"en_US" will currently default to "en".
